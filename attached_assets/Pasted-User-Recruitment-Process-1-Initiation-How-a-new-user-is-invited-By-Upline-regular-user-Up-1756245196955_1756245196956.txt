User Recruitment Process
1. Initiation (How a new user is invited)
By Upline (regular user):

Upline logs in → goes to “Add New User” ( “Generate Link”).

Upline chooses placement Left or Right leg.

System generates a unique referral link for that leg.

Link is sent directly to the new recruit. Initially he can make the changes ( eg. Passwords, KYC details etc mentioned in the sheet)

By Admin:

Admin can also generate a user link (just like a regular user).

But here, Admin does not need approval from upline.

Placement is decided by Admin at the time of link generation.

By Founder:

Founder can either:

Create new IDs directly.

OR use hidden IDs and place them in any leg (special privilege).

No one (not even Admin) can see or approve Founder placements.

2. Registration
New user clicks the referral link → redirected to Sign-Up Page.

User fills in details (Name, Email, Mobile, Password, KYC docs ).

Once submitted:

Credentials are auto-generated (User ID + Password). Once they login they should get the feature to change the password initially

They receive a confirmation email/SMS with login details.

Answer to your question:
Yes, new users get a joining link first. Once they register, they receive credentials (User ID + Password) via email.

3. Activation Logic
When does a user become “active”? 

User becomes active only after Admin approval (e.g., KYC + purchase checked).

Until purchase = status shows Registered / Inactive.

After 1st purchase = Active + counted in BV + appears in downline.

4. Approval & Placement Flow
Now, how does the approval work in different recruiter scenarios:

Case A – Recruiter is a User
Upline generates referral link (left/right leg).

New recruit registers.

Admin approves final activation (not upline).

After admin approval → recruit is placed in upline’s chosen leg.

Recruit now contributes to upline’s BV and team counts.

Case B – Recruiter is an Admin
Admin generates referral link (left/right).

New recruit registers.

Since Admin created the link, no extra approval step needed (Admin already has authority).

User is auto-placed and active after 1st purchase.

Case C – Recruiter is a Founder
Founder either:

Creates ID directly (hidden or regular).

Or generates referral link (left/right).

New recruit registers (if link is used).

Founder can override placement anytime.

E.g., shift user from left → right to balance BV. Even add fake entries in the particular leg

Activation = after 1st purchase (unless Founder overrides and manually activates).

Admin cannot see hidden IDs.

5. Scenario Handling
If Upline is Admin:

Workflow same as Case B.

No approval needed (Admin placing is final).

If Upline is Founder:

Founder has full override.

Hidden IDs can be inserted without following referral process.

If Recruiter is a Regular User:

Approval must come from Admin only (not upline).

Placement is locked at the time of referral link generation (Left/Right).

6. Key Safeguards
No Duplicate Placements: Once referral link is used, that position (Left/Right) is locked.

BV Calculation: BV counts only after activation (purchase).

KYC Enforcement: User must upload KYC within X days. If not → account locked for withdrawals.

Referral Link Expiry: Each generated link should expire in 24–48 hours to prevent misuse.
