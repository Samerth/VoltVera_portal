## Test Credentials

| User | Email | Password | Role | Description |
|------|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| Admin | admin@voltverashop.com | admin123 | Admin | System administrator |
| John | john.doe@example.com | admin123 | User | Level 1 member (upline) |

## Current Binary Tree Structure
```
Admin (Level 0)
└── John Doe (Level 1, LEFT under Admin)
    ├── Alice Smith (Level 2, LEFT under John)  
    │   └── Bob Johnson (Level 3, LEFT under Alice)
