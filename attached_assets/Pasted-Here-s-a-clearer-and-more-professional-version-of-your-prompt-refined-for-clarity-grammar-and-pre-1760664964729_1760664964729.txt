Here's a clearer and more professional version of your prompt, refined for clarity, grammar, and precision. This version can be shared with a developer, analyst, or BI team for implementation:

### **Improved Prompt**

Please revise and optimize the **Direct Income Report** and related reports with the following objectives and guidelines:

---

### **Primary Objectives**

1. **Group Data by User**

   * Ensure all income data is grouped by user.
   * Clearly show user-specific metrics to allow easy tracking and comparison.

2. **Fix the “Different” Column Issue**

   * Resolve any issues or ambiguities with the "Different" column (e.g., mislabeling, incorrect calculations, or unclear purpose).

3. **Highlight Key User Metrics**
   Reports should clearly show the following per user:

   * **Direct Income**
   * **Rank**
   * **Monthly and Lifetime BVM**
   * **Team Volume (monthly and lifetime if applicable)**
   * **Withdrawal Amounts**
   * **Rewards Eligibility (based on criteria such as rank, BVM, etc.)**

4. **Simplify Admin Decision-Making**

   * Structure the data and visual presentation to make it easy for the admin to:

     * Evaluate user performance
     * Verify reward eligibility
     * Audit income and withdrawal records
     * Understand business-wide trends

---

### **Report Validation & Testing**

* **Thoroughly test** all reports to ensure:

  * Data visibility is complete and accurate
  * Filters are functional and responsive
  * Totals, groupings, and calculations are correct
  * No broken UI components or misaligned columns

* Confirm that reports **accurately reflect business logic**, including income rules, BVM calculations, team qualifications, and reward thresholds.

---

### **Permissions & Flow**

* **Ensure that no existing workflows or data integrity are broken**.
* Retain all critical report functionalities currently in use.

---

### **Report Enhancements**

* You are encouraged to **create new reports or dashboards** if required to better represent:

  * User income flows
  * Qualification tracking
  * Reward milestones
  * Team performance breakdowns

---

### **General Guidelines**

* Prioritize clarity, accuracy, and performance.
* Use meaningful labels and descriptions in all report headers and filters.
* Ensure all numeric fields are properly formatted (e.g., currency, percentages, totals).
